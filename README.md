# Blood-Bank-BlockChain
Hello Daddie,
I made some improvements on your code.

These are the things I did to this submission:
1. Ensured that admin login can only be performed once.
2. Restricted permission management functions to the admin.
3. Added checks to ensure that donors and patients are not registered multiple times.
4. Fixed the donateBlood function to properly increment totalBloodDonated and update donorBalances.
5. Removed unnecessary parameter from the BloodRequested event.
6. Modified respondToRequest function to only be callable by the admin.
7.  Improved code readability by aligning parameter order in events with function definitions.
8. Minor optimization and readability improvements were made throughout the code.
